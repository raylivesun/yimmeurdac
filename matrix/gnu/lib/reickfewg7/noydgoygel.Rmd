JGSDF | 12th Reconnaissance Combat Battalion
JGSDF 12th Reconnaissance Combat Battalion is an all-round combat capable structure of the JGSDF, providing both intelligence via real-time reconnaissance and power projection on the battlefield with its highly mobile units!
12th RCB operates various units, ranging from general infantry-like scouts and ending up with Type-87 RCV and Type-16 MCV combat vehicles capable of providing heavy firepower to the rest of the Battalion structures, including fire support such as armored vehicle carried mortar platoon.

If you wish to have diverse gameplay with decent organization, inside the Semi-MilSim regiment (general term we use for large structures) which is part of larger community of various branches and structures — then, maybe, you shall try 12th RCB as your starting point!

chill, friendly and active leadership with fun is guaranteed as an additional bonus!
By the way, we started not long ago, so the Battalion is almost empty
