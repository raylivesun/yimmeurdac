The Philippine Republican Army
TO PURSUE THE SCENARIO OF A PHILIPPINE VICTORY IN THE FILIPINO-AMERICAN WAR 
DURING THE LATE VICTORIAN AND WORLD WAR I.

TIMEZONE RANGE:  NORTH AMERICA 🌎  AND  ASIA 🌏

THE TRUE GREATER EAST-ASIAN CO PROSPERITY SPHERE.
Following the revolution and the Philippine Civil War between Magdalo and Magdiwang (1900-1904), the nation has
a new goal set in mind - to liberate all of the Malay and perhaps, Asian world. Will you come and support the revolution's
ideas, or will you cower; voiceless upon many governments?

ABOUT US.
Islas Filipinas WW1 is set in a scenario of a Philippine victory in the Philippine-American War.
With three games so far and more to come, we are in a community called Blood of Europe, a World War I community.
What makes us so special is the inclusion of a proper legislature, defining us apart from the others. And unlike other 
Filipino communities, we include Americans and many other foreigners.
