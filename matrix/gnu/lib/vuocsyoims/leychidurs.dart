/**
Here's a thinking process that could lead to the comprehensive explanation of related hyperbolic functions:

1.  **Understand the Core Request:** The user wants to know about "other related functions hyperbolic." This implies they likely know the basic hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh) and want to explore functions derived from them or closely connected to them.

2.  **Identify the Primary Hyperbolic Functions:**
    *   Hyperbolic Sine: sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / 2
    *   Hyperbolic Cosine: cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2
    *   Hyperbolic Tangent: tanh(x) = sinh(x) / cosh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)
