Okay, that's a clear and concise statement of intent for the video. Here are a few slightly enhanced versions you could use, depending on the tone you want:

**Option 1 (Slightly more engaging):**

> "Welcome! In this video, we're diving into the world of hyperbolic functions. We'll define the three main players: **sinh(x)**, **cosh(x)**, and **tanh(x)**. We'll visualize them by looking at their graphs, and explore some of their key properties and how they relate to other functions you might know."

**Option 2 (Highlighting the connection to trig functions):**

> "Hi everyone. You're likely familiar with sine, cosine, and tangent. In this video, we'll introduce their cousins: the hyperbolic functions **sinh(x)**, **cosh(x)**, and **tanh(x)**. We'll define them, examine their unique graphs, and investigate some important properties, seeing how they compare and contrast with the standard trig functions."

**Option 3 (Very direct, similar to original but slightly warmer):**

> "In this video, our goal is to define the three fundamental hyperbolic functions: **f(x) = sinh(x)**, **f(x) = cosh(x)**, and **f(x) = tanh(x)**. We will carefully examine the graphs of these functions and investigate several of their important properties."

Choose the one that best fits the style of your video! They all accurately reflect the content you described.
