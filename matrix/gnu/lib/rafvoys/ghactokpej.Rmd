ðŸ“¢ Important Announcement to All Operators

Effective immediately, all drivers must remain at Woodlands Bus Park or Woodlands South Interchange for a minimum of 3 minutes upon arrival.

ðŸ•’ Purpose: This is to realistically simulate the unloading and loading of voters as part of our operational procedures.

âœ… Please ensure:

You do not depart before the 3-minute wait is over.

This rule is followed strictly to maintain immersion and realism in operations.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to high-quality simulation!

â€” Management Team
