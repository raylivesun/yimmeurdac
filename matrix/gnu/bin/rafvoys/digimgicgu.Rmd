:Springfalllogo: | Concerns about this airline leaking
Greetings @everyone, 

Springfall Airlines was immediately accused of leaking products during the flight. It's just common avionics whitelisting bugs and it also happens in other airlines if you're wondering. I'm also concerned I might get sued or lose my reputation with RoAviation Community but I'm informing everyone that every product in the airline was bought and I have the license on everything.

Sincerely,
@NotSpringy 
Chief Executive Officer | Springfall Airlines
Proof of purchase in avionics.
