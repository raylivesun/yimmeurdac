:Springfalllogo: | My Resignation
Greetings @everyone, 

It is time for me to officially step down from my position at Springfall Airlines. This decision was not easy, as I have invested considerable time and effort into the growth and quality of the airline.

Several factors contributed to my decision. Increasing commitments related to school, family, and personal future plans made it difficult for me to continue in this position. Furthermore, my interest in the Roblox aviation community naturally waned over time.

Despite this, my time at Springfall Airlines has been incredibly rewarding. I have had the pleasure of working with dedicated people and interacting with our passengers. These experiences have allowed me to grow both personally and professionally, and I am grateful for every moment.

I sincerely wish Springfall Airlines continued success and growth in the years to come.

Sincerely,
@MaityMax_12 
Chief Administrative Officer 
Aka Simon
