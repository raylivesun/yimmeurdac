The Japan Ground Self-Defense Forces was established in 1954 under Article 9 of the Constitution, which was enacted after Japan's defeat in World War II. As a result, it is restricted from using war to resolve disputes between states. Japan can only maintain the Self-Defense Forces, which are responsible for protecting Japan's sovereignty and stability, and cannot conduct military offensives. Their duty is only to defend against threats that may come to Japan.
