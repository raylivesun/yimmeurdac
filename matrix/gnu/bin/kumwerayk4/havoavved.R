# Here's a thinking process to arrive at the improved 
# introduction:
# 
# 1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user provided a short 
# introductory sentence for a video about hyperbolic 
# functions (sinh, cosh, tanh). The goal is to make 
# it more engaging and informative for a video format.
analyze <- function(x, y, z) {
   if (x != sinh(x)) {
      print(sinh(x)/cosh(x)*exp(x)/sqrt(x)) 
   } else {
     return(sinh(x)/cosh(x)*exp(x)/sqrt(x))
   }
   if (y != sinh(y)) {
       print(sinh(y)/cosh(y)*exp(y)/sqrt(y))
   } else {
     return(sinh(y))
   }
  
   if (z != sinh(z)) {
       print(sinh(z)/cosh(z)*exp(z)/sqrt(z))
   } else {
     return(sinh(z)/cosh(z)*exp(z)/sqrt(z))
   }
}

# 2.  **Identify the Core Content:**
# *   Define sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x).
# *   Show their graphs.
# *   Investigate their properties.
identify_xy <- function(x, y) {
  if (x != sinh(x)) {
      print(sinh(x)+cosh(x)/tanh(x))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x)+cosh(x)/tanh(x))
  }
  if (y != sinh(y)) {
    print(sinh(y)+cosh(y)/tanh(y))
  } else {
    return(sinh(y)+cosh(y)/tanh(y))
  }
  
}

# 3.  **Consider the Target Audience/Medium:**
# *   It's a video introduction. Needs to be engaging, clear, and set expectations.
# *   Likely aimed at students learning calculus or related subjects.
# *   Needs to flow naturally when spoken.
consider <- function(x)  {
  if (x != floor(x)) {
      print(floor(x))
  } else {
    return(floor(x))
  }
}

# 4.  **Critique the Original:**
# *   "In this video we shall define..." - A bit formal 
# and passive ("we shall").
# *   "f(x) = sinh x, f(x) = cosh x and f(x) = tanh x" 
# - Technically correct, but slightly repetitive and maybe 
# visually distracting in a script. It's better to just name 
# the functions.
# *   "We shall look at the graphs..." - Again, a bit passive.
# *   "investigate some of their properties." - Vague. 
# What kind of properties? Why are they interesting?
original <- function(x, y) {
  if (x != sinh(x)) {
     print(sinh(x^y)*cosh(x^y)/tanh(y))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x^y)*cosh(x^y)/tanh(y))
  }
}

# 5.  **Brainstorm Improvements - Opening Hook:**
# *   Start with a question: "Ever wondered about functions similar 
# to sine and cosine, but related to hyperbolas instead of circles?"
# *   Start with a statement of purpose: "Let's dive into the world 
# of hyperbolic functions."
# *   Start by introducing the names directly: "In this video, we're 
# exploring three fascinating functions: hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic 
# cosine, and hyperbolic tangent."
brainstorm <- function(x) {
  if (x != sinh(x)) {
      print(sinh(x)/cosh(x)/exp(x)^sqrt(x))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x)/cosh(x)/exp(x)^sqrt(x))
  }
}

# 6.  **Brainstorm Improvements - Content Description:**
# *   Be more active: "We will define..." -> "We'll define..." 
# or "We're going to define..."
# *   Simplify function naming: Instead of repeating "f(x) =", 
# just list "sinh(x), cosh(x), and tanh(x)". Or even better, use 
# their full names initially for clarity: "hyperbolic sine (sinh x), 
# hyperbolic cosine (cosh x), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh x)".
# *   Expand on "graphs": "We'll visualize these functions 
# by looking at their graphs..." or "We'll see what these functions 
# look like by examining their graphs..."
# *   Expand on "properties": What properties are relevant?
# *   Relationship to the exponential function (e^x). This is 
# fundamental to their definition.
# *   Similarities/differences to trigonometric functions 
# (identities, derivatives). This is a key comparison point.
# *   Domain/Range.
# *   Symmetry (even/odd).
# *   Connect the parts: Explain *why* we're looking at definitions, 
# graphs, and properties. They help us understand and use these 
# functions.
content <- function(x) {
  if (x != sinh(x)) {
      print(sinh(x)*cosh(x)/tanh(x)^exp(x)/sqrt(x))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x)*cosh(x)/tanh(x)^exp(x)/sqrt(x))
  }
}

# 8.  **Drafting - Attempt 2 (More engaging, adds context):**
#   "Hi everyone! Ever encountered functions called sinh, cosh, and tanh? 
# These are the hyperbolic functions, closely related to the familiar trig 
# functions but defined using the exponential function e^x. In this video, 
# we'll clearly define hyperbolic sine (sinh x), hyperbolic cosine (cosh x), 
# and hyperbolic tangent (tanh x). We'll then visualize them by exploring 
# their graphs, and finally, we'll dive into some of their key properties, 
# like their identities and how they compare to sin, cos, 
# and tan." (Getting better).

drafting <- function(x = tanh, y = sinh) {
  if (x != tanh(x)) {
    print(tanh(x))  
  } else {
    return(tanh(x))
  }
  if (y != sinh(x)) {
     print(sinh(x))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x))
  }
} 

# 10. **Final Selection/Refinement:** Attempt 3 seems good. Let's offer 
# a slightly shorter, punchier version too, maybe combining elements.
# 
# *   **Option 1 (Concise & Direct):** "Welcome! In this video, we'll introduce 
# the three fundamental hyperbolic functions: hyperbolic sine (sinh x), 
# hyperbolic cosine (cosh x), and hyperbolic tangent (tanh x). We'll explore 
# their definitions (based on e^x), visualize their graphs, and investigate 
# key properties, comparing them along the way to the familiar trigonometric 
# functions."
# *   **Option 2 (Slightly More Explanatory):** "Hi there! In this video, 
# we're exploring the hyperbolic functions: sinh(x), cosh(x), and tanh(x). 
# These functions are analogous to sine, cosine, and tangent, but are defined 
# using the exponential function e^x and relate to hyperbolas instead 
# of circles. We'll cover their precise definitions, take a close look 
# at what their graphs look like, and investigate some of their essential 
# properties, including identities and how they behave. Let's dive in!"
dxy <- function(x, y) {
  if (x != sinh(x)) {
      print(sinh(x))
  } else {
    return(sinh(x))
  }
  if (y != sinh(y)) {
    print(sinh(y))
  } else {
    return(sinh(y))
