Decisions will be based on the general principles that ultimately promote healthy communities as well as assumption that members act in good faith.

Guidelines may be amended based on future developments and feedback. Offenses that disrupt our community may result in a temporary mute, permanent mute, or ban - depending on the severity and repetition of the offense.
